        Made a huge performance boost to improve startup time. Modules such as
            File::Slurp, JSON, YAML and LWP are only loaded if needed.
        Use L instead of Class::Autouse to fix issue with loading DateTime.
            This used to not work: p 'S DateTime->today'
        Thanks Stanislaw Pusep! (https://github.com/creaktive)
